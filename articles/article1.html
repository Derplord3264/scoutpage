                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To begin, you'll need a CPU, or Central Processing Unit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">

                        <i>Note: your CPU will not look like this. This is an older CPU.</i>

                    <br>
                    There are 2 major brands you can get your CPU from, being AMD and Intel. AMD's CPUs tend to be cheaper and have better price-to-performance, while Intel's CPUs are some of the fastest in the world,<br>
                    albeit rather expensive. For a good (but not overkill) AMD CPU, you can expect to be paying anywhere from $229 to $359, while for an Intel CPU of equal power, you could pay anywhere from $250 to $300.
                    <br>

                        <img src="images/ryzen7.jpg" style="height: 45vh; width: 55vh;">

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Moving on, the next thing you will need is a GPU, also known as a graphics card, or, more formally, a Graphics Processing Unit.<br>
                    This component handles drawing all the graphics on your screen, such as games, browsers, or other programs, so you'll want to get a nice one.<br>
                    Unfortunately, thanks to the bad GPU market right now, the prices are sky-high, and it is difficult to get a good one at even a low-ish price.<br>
                    To give some perspective on this, a good GPU (like the RTX 4070-Ti) will run you upwards of $700. However, you can get your hands on some cheaper cards, but they will be lower-performance.<br>
                    However, some cards balance price to performance spectacularly, such as Intel's new line of Arc GPUs (the Arc A310, A380, A580, A750, and A770).<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">
                        <img src="images/a770.jpg" style="height: 45vh; width: 55vh;">
                        <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Personally, I own the Arc A770 16GB. I think that it's a spectacular card. However, you must remember that this all boils down to personal preference and<br>
                    your specific needs. Do you need power for gaming? AI? Software development? Or do you just need something that you can use to browse the web?

                    <br>
                    Next up: the motherboard.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">
                        <img src="images/mobo.jpg" style="height: 45vh; width: 55vh;">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>Note: your motherboard will not look like this. This is an older motherboard.</i>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your motherboard is a very important part of the computer, as it links all the components together. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.<br>
                    You do not necessarily need a very expensive or feature-filled motherboard, though. You probably don't even need Wi-Fi, as you can buy a spectacular Wi-Fi 7 dongle for around $60,<br>
                    or you can get a run of the mill Wi-Fi 2 or 3 dongle for around $10.<br>
                    Moreover, as long as the motherboard has the correct socket type for your CPU, you are fine. Just make sure you don't buy a brand-new motherboard with an outdated socket type that can't be upgraded over time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Moving on again! Now it's time for Random Access Memory, better known as RAM.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">

                    Memory is what your computer reaches for when it needs to store things very temporarily, like game data (this is why loading takes a while).<br>
                    There are two things you need to consider when buying RAM: capacity and frequency. Capacity is how much space the RAM can hold (normally 16 or 32 gigabytes), and frequency is how fast<br>
                    data can be read or written to your RAM. Usually, faster is better.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Onwards we continue!<br>
                    It is now time to pick your CPU cooler.<br>
                    This is a spectacularly important choice for you to make, as it decides how easily your CPU overheats.<br>
                    There are two main types of CPU coolers: an air cooler,<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">
                        <img src="images/aircooler.jpg" style="height: 45vh; width: 55vh;">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>A be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5 Air Cooler priced at $71.90.</i>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    or an AIO (All in One) cooler.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">
                        <img src="images/aio.jpg" style="height: 38vh; width: 55vh;">
                        <br>

                        <i>An ASUS ROG Strix LC II ARGB AIO fitted for an Intel LGA socket.</i>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As they are powered by water (yes, water), AIO coolers tend to be more efficient and more powerful<br>
                    thanks to water's spectacular heat conduction properties. However, despite this enchanced efficiency,<br>
                    they are rather expensive (ranging from ~$80 to ~$250).<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Onwards again!<br>
                    Time to choose your case. Your case is, as you could have probably guessed, the box that your computer sits inside.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="imgframe">
                        <img src="images/case.jpg" style="height: 65vh; width: 55vh;">

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is the main part that you should cut back on if you are on a budget, as it has no influence on how fast your computer runs (besides airflow, but we'll get to that in a minute).<br>
                    There are many different things you can look for in a case, including size (ATX midtower, ATX fulltower, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, etc), side panel type (metal, acrylic, tempered glass), and just style.<br>
                    <br>
