                <p>
                    Get a hold of your partially assembled PC from Part 2 as well as your PC case.<br>
                    Place your PC into the case after removing all accessories. Screw the motherboard into the case by using the screws included with the case.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Good job. You have installed your case.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To insert your GPU, align the notch, push the GPU in, and screw the I/O shield into the case. Plug in the power supply cabling.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
